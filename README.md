You have been tasked to create a simple version of this game with Python. In your version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player). 

Rock paper scissors game developed by Sunday Jimoh as a task during the Zuri x I4G training on Full-Stack-Python.

The aim of the task was to learn more about creating and using python packages.

The choice method of the random module was used along with dictionaries and lists.

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors

When the program is run, the user is asked to pick an option between "R", "P" or "S" If user input is invalid (not amongst our options), an error message is printed, and their input is asked for again.

Check both player's moves: If there is a winner, the winner is printed, and the program ends. If it's a tie (the computer and player pick the same move), the user input is asked for again and the game continues.
